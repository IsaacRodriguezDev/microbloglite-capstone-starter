# Enjoy the Microblog Project and the MicroblogLite API!

Don't forget to read the [*MicroblogLite* API docs](http://microbloglite.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/docs) and experiment with the API in *Postman!*

Practice and experimentation provide experience, and experience provides confidence.


## Descrition
In this project I built a blog project I named Chatter. This website allows users to share brief insights for different individuals to see.


## Login Page

In the login page there is a form that takes in username and password and an optional sign up button for unregistered users.

## Register Page

The register page allows the user to create an account by taking in a username, that hasn't been taken already, as well as full name, and a password. Followed by the register button that submits the form and a login button to take the user back to the login page.

## Posts page

The post page displays up to 100 of the most recent posts created by different users. There is a like button and dislike button that when clicked will give a like and show all current likes to the post. It also shows the username of the person who created the post and timestamp of when the post was made.

## Profile page

The profile shows a picture and the username of the person who is logged in. It allows you to create a post for users to see on the post page.

## A cool piece of code

I thought this piece of code was cool because it removes any existing input element so there's no duplicates with the same value when trying to get the data._id of the post.
